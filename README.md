## What is in this repo?

We of course hope that you attend one of our in person workshops and are using this repo to work through the labs with the other attendees. However, we also want you do be able to do the labs at your own pace and revisit when you are building your own projects in the future. We also recognize you may not be able to attend an in person event - so we've included everything you need from the workshop in this repo.
